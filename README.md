Project 1: 
https://github.com/ShivamPatel0703/Project-1
This is a Password Generator Program that allows users to create different passwords for each domain they visit

Project 2:
https://github.com/ShivamPatel0703/Project-2-3-Libraries-
This is Project 2 which includes three seperate programs, each using a different library. Program 1 uses the networking/socket library to create a simple socket connection. Program 2(even though the name is fakerLib2.py, I uploaded the wrong source code, the real one is the code using PIL) uses the PIL(Python Imaging Library) and uses some important functions and features to do simple tasks. Program 3 uses MATPLOTLIB to create a graph of birthdays. 

Project 3:
https://github.com/ShivamPatel0703/Project-3/blob/main/Clock.py
This project 3 is a program of a digital clock. I used the Tkinter library to efficiently create a digital clock that could be used by anyone.
